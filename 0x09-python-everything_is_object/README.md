# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Overview

This project delves into the intricate world of Python objects, focusing on the concepts of immutability, mutability, references, and aliasing. Through this exploration, participants will gain a deeper understanding of how Python manages objects and variables, an essential knowledge base for effective Python programming and debugging.

## Background Context

Understanding how variable assignments and modifications affect data in Python is crucial. This project uses thought experiments and discussions to uncover the behaviors of Python objects without immediate experimentation, encouraging a theoretical understanding before practical application.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Articulate why Python is a preferred programming language.
- Define what an object is in Python.
- Distinguish between classes, objects, and instances.
- Explain the differences between mutable and immutable objects.
- Understand what a reference is and how Python uses it to manage data.
- Describe what an assignment does and how aliasing affects variables.
- Identify methods to check if two variables are identical or refer to the same object.
- Use Python commands to display the memory address of a variable.
- List Python's built-in mutable and immutable types.
- Explain how Python passes variables to functions.

## Resources

- **Reading:**
  - "9.10. Objects and values"
  - "9.11. Aliasing"
  - "Immutable vs mutable types"
  - "Mutation" (Only this chapter)
  - "9.12. Cloning lists"
  - "Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing"

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- **Environment:** All files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Coding Style:** All Python files must adhere to Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- **Editors Allowed:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Script Requirements:**
  - Must begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Must be executable
  - Must end with a new line

### .txt Answer Files

- **Format:**
  - Only one line per answer file.
  - No shebang in any files.
  - Each file must end with a new line.

## More Info

- This project encourages deep thinking and discussion before coding to solidify understanding of object behaviors in Python. This approach is particularly beneficial for preparing for Python-related job interviews where such questions are common.
