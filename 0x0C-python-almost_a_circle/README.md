# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive review of Python programming, covering a variety of topics to prepare for larger projects like the AirBnB clone in the Higher level curriculum. It encapsulates concepts such as import, exceptions, class attributes, serialization/deserialization, JSON, and unittesting, providing a thorough preparation through practical application and testing.

## Background Context

This module serves as an essential preparatory stage for understanding and implementing complex Python projects. It integrates various Python programming facets that are crucial for developing scalable and robust applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Explain the purpose of unit testing and its implementation in large projects.
- Serialize and deserialize classes effectively.
- Write to and read from JSON files.
- Utilize `*args` and `**kwargs` to manage variable numbers of arguments in functions.
- Handle named arguments in function calls.
- Understand and apply Python's unittest framework for creating and running tests.

## Resources

- **Reading:**
  - "args/kwargs"
  - "JSON encoder and decoder"
  - "unittest module"
  - "Python test cheatsheet"

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- **Environment:** All files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Coding Style:** All Python files must adhere to Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- **Editors Allowed:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Script Requirements:**
  - Must begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Must be executable
  - Must end with a new line
  - Include comprehensive docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.

### Python Unit Tests

- **Test File Location:** All test files should be placed in a folder named `tests`.
- **File Type:** All test files should be python files with a `.py` extension.
- **Naming Convention:** Files and folders should start with `test_`, mirroring the project structure.
- **Execution:** 
  - Execute all tests using the command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
  - Individual tests can be run using: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- **Documentation:** Each module, class, and function must have a detailed docstring explaining its purpose.

## More Info

- Collaboration on test case development is encouraged to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential edge cases. However, the implementation of these tests should be done individually to adhere to best practices in coding and testing.
