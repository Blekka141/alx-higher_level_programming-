# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Overview

This project further explores the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, building on previous lessons about classes and objects. It focuses on advanced topics such as class attributes, class methods, static methods, and the distinctions between different types of methods and attributes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Discuss why Python programming is beneficial.
- Define Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- Explain the concept of "first-class everything" in Python.
- Describe what a class is and how it differs from objects and instances.
- Understand the use of `self` and how it relates to objects within classes.
- Implement the `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__` methods and understand their purposes.
- Distinguish between public, protected, and private attributes.
- Define what data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding are.
- Differentiate between attributes and properties, and implement Pythonic getters and setters.
- Explain the purpose of class attributes and methods, and when to use static methods.
- Use the `__dict__` attribute to examine the attributes of a class and its instances.
- Dynamically create attributes for classes and manage them effectively.
- Utilize the `getattr` function to access attributes dynamically.

## Resources

- **Reading:**
  - "Object Oriented Programming" (up to "Inheritance" excluded)
  - "Properties vs. Getters and Setters"
  - "Class and Instance Attributes"
  - "classmethods and staticmethods"
  - "str vs repr"

## Requirements

### General

- **Environment:** All files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Coding Style:** All Python files must adhere to Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- **Editors Allowed:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Script Requirements:**
  - Must begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Must be executable
  - Must end with a new line
  - Documentation is required for every module, class, and function to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## More Info

- Emphasis is placed on proper documentation and understanding the underlying principles of OOP to prepare for more complex software development tasks using Python.
