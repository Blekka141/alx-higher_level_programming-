# Python MySQL Database Connectivity with ORM

This project aims to demonstrate the integration of Python with MySQL databases, focusing on both traditional SQL querying using MySQLdb and Object Relational Mapping (ORM) using SQLAlchemy.

## Background

In this project, you will learn how to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script using both MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy modules. The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Using MySQLdb**: This part involves connecting to a MySQL database using the MySQLdb module and executing SQL queries directly.

2. **Using SQLAlchemy ORM**: Here, you will utilize SQLAlchemy, an ORM library, to abstract the database interaction and work with Python objects directly, without writing explicit SQL queries.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain proficiency in the following areas:

- Understanding the advantages of Python programming for database connectivity.
- Connecting to a MySQL database from a Python script using MySQLdb.
- Performing SELECT and INSERT operations on MySQL tables from Python.
- Grasping the concept of ORM and its benefits.
- Mapping Python classes to MySQL tables.
- Creating a Python Virtual Environment for project isolation.

## Requirements

- **Editors**: Allowed editors include vi, vim, emacs.
- **Interpreter**: Python scripts will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Dependencies**: MySQLdb version 2.0.x and SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x are required.
- **Code Style**: Ensure adherence to PEP 8 guidelines using pycodestyle.
- **Documentation**: All modules, classes, and functions should be well-documented.
- **Executable Files**: Ensure all files are executable.
- **README**: Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
