# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Overview
This project is an introduction to Python programming, emphasizing basic concepts like string manipulation, variables, and basic I/O. This initial dive is designed to familiarize with Python's unique qualities compared to C.

## Author's Disclaimer
This first Python project leans towards a "C-oriented" approach, straightforward and unembellished. If you have prior experience with Python, the forthcoming challenges will stimulate more complex applications, demonstrating Python's flexibility and varied methodologies for accomplishing tasks.

## Resources
- [The Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) (Chapters 1 to 3)
- [How To Use String Formatters in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)
- [Pycodestyle – Style Guide for Python Code](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/en/latest/)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand why Python is an excellent programming choice.
- Recognize the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum.
- Learn the origins of Python’s name and the philosophy behind its design.
- Master basic operations in Python, including string handling and file I/O.
- Familiarize with Python's official coding style and enforce it using Pycodestyle.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- **Environment**: Scripts will be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Execution**: First line of all your scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Checks**: Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- **Documentation**: A README.md file at the project's root should describe the project's purpose.

### Shell Scripts
- **Environment**: Scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- **Length**: Scripts must be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2).

### C Scripts
- **Compiler**: GCC on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- **Style**: Code should adhere to Betty style.
