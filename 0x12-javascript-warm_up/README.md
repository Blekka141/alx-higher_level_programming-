# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

## Overview

This project marks the introduction to JavaScript programming, focusing on basic scripting techniques and the fundamentals of web front-end development. Over the course of this project, participants will learn the syntax and core concepts of JavaScript, preparing them for more complex applications including dynamic web development.

## Background Context

JavaScript is essential for modern web development, involved in both client-side and server-side scripting. This project begins with scripting to establish a solid foundation in JavaScript basics before applying these skills to make web applications dynamic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Explain why JavaScript programming is a critical skill for modern web development.
- Run JavaScript scripts using Node.js.
- Define and use variables and constants using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Understand the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- Describe all data types supported by JavaScript.
- Implement control flow with if-else conditions and loops (while, for).
- Use functions and understand their scope and return behavior.
- Manipulate objects and arrays, and understand intrinsic objects.
- Import modules and separate code into different files for better manageability.
