# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Overview

This project introduces the concept of inheritance in Python, focusing on how classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes. Participants will explore the functionality of superclass, subclass, and multiple inheritance scenarios to understand how to effectively reuse and extend existing code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is preferred for rapid development.
- Define what a superclass, baseclass, or parent class is.
- Understand the concept of a subclass.
- List all attributes and methods of a class or instance.
- Describe the conditions under which an instance can have new attributes.
- Demonstrate how to inherit a class from another.
- Define a class with multiple base classes.
- Identify the default class from which every class inherits.
- Override methods or attributes inherited from the base class.
- Determine which attributes and methods a subclass can inherit.
- Discuss the purpose of inheritance in object-oriented programming.
- Use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` functions effectively.

## Resources

- **Reading:**
  - "Inheritance"
  - "Multiple inheritance"
  - "Inheritance in Python"
  - "Learn to Program 10: Inheritance Magic Methods"

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- **Environment:** All files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Coding Style:** All Python files must adhere to Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- **Editors Allowed:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Script Requirements:**
  - Must begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Must be executable
  - Must end with a new line
  - Comprehensive docstrings must be included for modules, classes, and functions.

### Python Test Cases

- **Test File Location:** All test files should be placed in a folder named `tests`.
- **File Type:** All test files should be text files with a `.txt` extension.
- **Execution:** Tests should be run using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- **Documentation:** Every module, class, and method must have a detailed docstring explaining its purpose. The length and content of these docstrings will be verified.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Avoid using the words "import" or "from" in comments, as the checker might mistake these for actual import statements.

## More Info

- Collaboration on test case development is encouraged to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential edge cases. However, the implementation of these tests should be done individually to adhere to best practices in coding and testing.
