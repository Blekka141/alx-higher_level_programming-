# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Overview

This project introduces the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It focuses on the fundamentals of classes and objects, aiming to build a strong foundation in Python OOP practices. The project encourages participants to experiment with OOP to understand its mechanics and benefits in programming.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome.
- Define what Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is.
- Understand the concept of "first-class everything" in Python.
- Differentiate between classes, objects, and instances.
- Identify and use class attributes, and understand their scope (public, protected, private).
- Describe what 'self' refers to in class methods.
- Utilize the special `__init__` method for initializing new objects.
- Discuss the principles of Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding.
- Explain the role of properties versus plain attributes.
- Implement getters and setters the Pythonic way.
- Dynamically add attributes to objects.
- Use the `__dict__` attribute to explore the attributes of a class and its instances.
- Apply the `getattr` function to access attributes dynamically.
