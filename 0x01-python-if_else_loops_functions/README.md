# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Overview

This project focuses on fundamental programming concepts in Python, emphasizing control flow tools up to defining functions. It serves as an introduction to Python programming for those familiar with C, highlighting the unique features and syntax of Python.

## Project Details

- **Duration:** January 2, 2024, 6:00 AM to January 3, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Review:** An auto review was launched at the deadline.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- The appeal of Python programming.
- The critical role of indentation in Python.
- Usage of if and if...else statements.
- The function and usage of comments in Python.
- Variable assignment.
- The workings of while and for loops, and how Python's for loop differs from C's.
- The use of break, continue, and pass statements in loops.
- How to implement else clauses on loops and use the range function.
- The basics of functions in Python, including scope and the implications of omitting the return statement.
- Handling tracebacks and understanding arithmetic operators in Python.
