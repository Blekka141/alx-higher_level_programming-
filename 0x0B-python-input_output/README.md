# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Overview

This project focuses on file handling in Python, including reading, writing, and manipulating files. Participants will explore various I/O operations, understand the use of JSON for serialization and deserialization, and learn how to manage file resources efficiently using Python.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Discuss why Python programming is ideal for handling file input and output.
- Open a file using different modes in Python.
- Write text to a file and read the full content or line by line.
- Move the cursor within a file for targeted data access.
- Ensure that a file is properly closed after its operations are completed.
- Utilize the `with` statement to manage file contexts automatically.
- Define JSON and its use cases in data interchange.
- Understand serialization and deserialization processes.
- Convert Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa.

## Resources

- **Reading:**
  - "7.2. Reading and Writing Files"
  - "8.7. Predefined Clean-up Actions"
  - "Dive Into Python 3: Chapter 11. Files" (up to "11.4 Binary Files" included)
  - "JSON encoder and decoder"
  - "Learn to Program 8: Reading / Writing Files"
  - "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" (chapters on file I/O)
  - "All about py-file I/O"

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- **Environment:** All files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- **Coding Style:** All Python files must adhere to Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- **Editors Allowed:** vi, vim, emacs.
- **Script Requirements:**
  - Must begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - Must be executable
  - Must end with a new line
  - Include comprehensive docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.

### Python Test Cases

- **Test File Location:** All test files should be placed in a folder named `tests`.
- **File Type:** All test files should be text files with a `.txt` extension.
- **Execution:** Tests should be run using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- **Documentation:** Every module, class, and method must have a detailed docstring explaining its purpose. The length and content of these docstrings will be verified.

## More Info

- Collaboration on test case development is encouraged to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential edge cases. However, the implementation of these tests should be done individually to adhere to best practices in coding and testing.
