# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Overview

This project continues the exploration of Python data structures by focusing on sets and dictionaries. It aims to equip participants with the skills to effectively use these data structures in Python, highlighting their applications, benefits, and differences from other types such as lists.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants should be able to:

- Articulate why Python programming is preferred by many developers.
- Understand and utilize sets, including their common methods.
- Decide when to use sets over lists.
- Iterate through sets efficiently.
- Comprehend dictionaries, their utility, and how to use them.
- Choose between using dictionaries and other data structures like lists or sets.
- Explain the role of keys in dictionaries and how to iterate over them.
- Define lambda functions and identify their uses.
- Apply the map, reduce, and filter functions effectively in data manipulation.
